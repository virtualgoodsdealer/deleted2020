Especially when it comes to the exposure of the \r\nnaked body. In this collaboration the artists aim to „play with“ and challenge the masculinized gaze \r\nin an ironic and humorous way to gesture toward agency for young women. \r\n(Digital Photography)\r\n\r\nMy instagram name is @cretaceo .\r\n\r\nThank you for consideration and happy new year,\r\n\r\nJulia Maria Gruber\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But mostly, uploading \r\nphotos just means being honest and vulnerable with myself. In 2020, \r\nInstagram deleted two photos for nudity, even though the photos were far \r\nfrom sexualised or offensive. I felt hurt by this censorship, felt again \r\nthat I was not allowed to take up space, that I had to please others to \r\nbe accepted.

The deletion of sex workers and sex positive\r\ncontent is a political issue, a class issue, and an attack on\r\nrepresentation, inclusivity and progress in a violent world.\r\nThe community I have grown with on instagram has been so pivotal to shaping\r\nmy worldview with sex positive content, education, and an engaged,\r\nopen-minded community. I'll be happy to move to a new platform with all my\r\nfavorite creatives. I believe that if we were to listen to the most\r\nmarginalized and shape the world based on their needs we would all be\r\nbetter for it. That's what I want; decriminalization, sex worker\r\nsovereignty, and a life-affirming world for Black Trans and Indigenous\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n(Note: I made another submission through my modeling account--where my\r\nalias is Dizzie @dizzie_nova)\r\n\r\nIMAGE INFO\r\n\r\nModel: Hailey Christensen @desirabledigitals\r\n\r\nPhotographer: Aurora Adams @auroraprophoto\r\n"

Shout out to latex and flash photography for this\r\nembodied practice of enjoyment and self celebration.\"\r\n\r\nI reposted to add:\r\n\r\n\"Hi, so I was going to focus on body self acceptance, but then @instagram\r\ntook my post down(this image) stating it violates community guidelines\r\nagainst nudity and sexual activity.\r\nNot only is this *not* a sexual image, it has already\r\ncensored my(apparently inherently sexual and sexualized) nipples.\r\nFuck you and fuck your bots policing women's bodies and self expression.\r\nThis exact photo was Not flagged on my male collegue's account.

People who are so inclined can weaponize being offended, or even feigning concern for mental health in order to silence content creators, and generally this behavior is rewarded regardless of whether or not it’s warranted. Being alive is fucked up and messy, and being denied the cathartic process of expressing that through art feels so soulless and ugly it makes me wonder what I personally get out utilizing this platform specifically other than a dopamine feedback loop that is just a cheap trick making a fool out of my dumb lizard brain like a slot machine or a scratch off lottery ticket. The fact I am obviously being influenced to make my work so sterile and with a total lack of boundary-pushing energy can make it seem like a waste of time to try and make anything that’s worth seeing in the first place.
